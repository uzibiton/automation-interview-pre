## 🚀 Deployment for PWA:

### **For Production PWA (requires HTTPS):**

PWA requires **HTTPS** for service workers (except localhost).

**Free Hosting Options:**

1. **Netlify** - Free HTTPS, easy deploy
2. **Vercel** - Free HTTPS, automatic SSL
3. **GitHub Pages** - Free HTTPS
4. **Firebase Hosting** - Free tier, auto HTTPS

**Note:** Your current backend (NestJS + PostgreSQL) needs separate hosting.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### **Install button not showing:**

- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure `manifest.json` loads correctly
- Verify service worker registered successfully
- Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

### **Service worker not registering:**

- Check `/sw.js` file exists
- Open DevTools -> Application -> Service Workers
- Click "Update" or "Unregister" and refresh

### **Icons not displaying:**

- Check `/icon-192.svg` and `/icon-512.svg` exist
- Verify manifest.json has correct icon paths
- Clear cache and refresh

### **Offline mode not working:**

- Service worker needs time to cache on first visit
- Visit app once, then try offline
- Check Network tab -> Service Worker shows "activated"
