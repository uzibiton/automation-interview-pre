## 🎯 Project Goals & SDET Focus

### Business Context

A multi-tenant expense tracking application with authentication, CRUD operations, analytics, and internationalization (English/Hebrew).

### SDET Perspective

- **Quality-First Architecture**: Design testable systems from the ground up
- **Shift-Left Testing**: Catch issues early through comprehensive test coverage
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Reproducible environments and automated deployments
- **Observability**: Built-in logging, monitoring, and debugging capabilities
- **Multi-Environment Strategy**: Isolated staging, production, and PR environments

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Infrastructure

### Technology Stack

```
Frontend:  React + TypeScript + Vite
Backend:   NestJS + TypeScript
Database:  Firestore (NoSQL) / PostgreSQL (optional)
Auth:      Google OAuth 2.0 + JWT
Cloud:     Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run)
CI/CD:     GitHub Actions
Testing:   Playwright (E2E) + Jest (Unit) + Allure (Reporting)
```

### Multi-Environment Strategy

```

              │   └─ auth-service-staging-*.run.app
              │
              ├─► Manual Trigger -> Production Environment

              │   ├─ api-service-*.run.app
              │   └─ auth-service-*.run.app
              │
              └─► Pull Request -> PR Environment (Ephemeral)
                  ├─ frontend-pr-{PR_NUM}-*.run.app
                  ├─ Auto-created on PR open
                  └─ Auto-destroyed on PR merge/close
```

**SDET Insight**: Ephemeral PR environments enable true isolation testing without environment conflicts or data pollution.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Design

### GitHub Actions Workflow Architecture

```yaml
Trigger: Push to main
  ├─► Build & Test Phase
  │   ├─ Install dependencies
  │   ├─ Run unit tests
  │   ├─ TypeScript compilation check
  │   └─ Lint code quality
  │
  ├─► Docker Build Phase (Parallel)
  │   ├─ Build frontend image
  │   ├─ Build api-service image
  │   └─ Build auth-service image
  │
  ├─► Deploy to Staging (Sequential)
  │   ├─ Deploy auth-service -> wait for ready
  │   ├─ Deploy api-service -> wait for ready
  │   └─ Deploy frontend -> wait for ready
  │
  └─► Post-Deployment Validation
  ├─ Health checks (all services)
  ├─ Smoke tests (critical paths)
  └─ Allure report generation
```

### Key SDET Principles Applied

#### 1. **Fail Fast Strategy**

- Lint and type-check before building Docker images
- Unit tests run before deployment
- Health checks prevent bad deployments from completing

#### 2. **Deployment Safety**

- Services deploy sequentially (auth -> api -> frontend)
- Each service waits for "ready" state before proceeding
- Rollback mechanism via Cloud Run revisions

#### 3. **Environment Isolation**

- Separate databases per environment (design goal)
- Environment-specific secrets and configs
- No cross-environment data leakage

#### 4. **Observability**

- Structured logging with context (user ID, request ID)
- Cloud Run native monitoring
- Application-level error tracking

## 🔍 Quality Engineering Approach

### Problem-Solving Methodology

#### Real Example: Staging Crash on Login

**Symptom**: Frontend crashes with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"

**Investigation Process**:

1. ✅ Check deployment status -> All services running
2. ✅ Check API logs -> All 200 responses, no errors
3. ✅ Compare local vs staging -> Works locally, fails remotely
4. ✅ Identify pattern -> Frontend expects arrays, API returns undefined/null
5. ✅ Root cause -> Missing defensive programming in API response handling

**Solution Applied**:

```typescript
// Before (crashes)
expenses.map(...)

// After (defensive)
const expenses = Array.isArray(response.data) ? response.data : [];
expenses.map(...)
```

**SDET Takeaway**:

- Always validate external data sources
- Never trust API responses implicitly
- Add fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation

---

#### Real Example: Graph Not Rendering

**Symptom**: Stats displayed as 0, pie chart empty

**Investigation Process**:

1. ✅ Check API response structure -> Returns `by_category` (snake_case)
2. ✅ Check frontend expectations -> Expects `byCategory` (camelCase)
3. ✅ Check date filtering -> Date objects compared to string dates in Firestore
4. ✅ Root cause -> Dual issue: naming mismatch + date format mismatch

**Solutions Applied**:

```typescript
// Issue 1: API-Frontend contract mismatch
// API now returns: { byCategory: [{ categoryId: 1, total: 50 }] }
// Frontend expects: { byCategory: [{ categoryId: 1, total: 50 }] }

// Issue 2: Date comparison in Firestore
const startDateStr =
  filters.startDate instanceof Date
    ? filters.startDate.toISOString().split('T')[0]
    : filters.startDate;
```

**SDET Takeaway**:

- API contracts must be explicit and enforced
- Type safety prevents interface mismatches
- Database query filters need data type awareness

---

### Debugging & Troubleshooting Toolkit

```bash
# Check deployment status
gcloud run services list --platform=managed --region=us-central1

# View real-time logs
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=api-service-staging" --limit=20

# Check specific errors
gcloud logging read "severity>=ERROR" --limit=10 --format=json

# Verify database contents
node scripts/check-expenses.js

# Manual health check
curl https://api-service-staging-*.run.app/health
```

**SDET Insight**: Scriptable debugging workflows enable rapid issue diagnosis in production.
